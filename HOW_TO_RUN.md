## Troubleshooting

### App Issues
- If the app crashes, make sure all required permissions are granted (microphone, camera, storage)  
- If OCR does not work well, use a clear, well-lit image  
- If speech recognition fails, ensure your phone supports the Hindi language  

### Build Script Issues
- **Problems with `build_with_gradle.bat`:**  
  - If Gradle is not found, the script will try to download it automatically  
  - If you donâ€™t have internet, use `build_apk.bat` instead  
  - If compilation errors occur, open the project in Android Studio to debug  

- **Problems with `build_apk.bat`:**  
  - If you see "Android SDK build tools not found":  
    - Install Android SDK (via Android Studio)  
    - Or use `build_with_gradle.bat`  
  - If you see "Java JDK not found":  
    - Install Java JDK and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable  

- **APK Installation Issues:**  
  - If "App not installed" error appears:  
    - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" on your phone (Settings > Security > Unknown sources)  
    - If an older version is already installed, uninstall it first and then install the new APK
